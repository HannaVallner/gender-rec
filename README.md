# Project E6: KAGGLE-GENDER-REC
## Predicting Gender by Voice and Speech Analysis
Team members: Kaidi Tootmaa, Hanna Vallner 

The project consists of two main parts: the first part was to create a machine learning model, which predicts the gender of a person based on voice and speech analysis data. The second part analyzes the correlation between the gender of a person and the different features of their voice. The dataset for the project is sourced from Kaggle.

The project has been made for the Introduction to Data Science course at the University of Tartu, at the end of 2022.
The project plan, initial analysis and goals can be found in the gender-rec.pdf file.
The project code is provided as a Jupyter Notebook file. The code requires data from voice.csv to run (therefore to run the code, two files – Project.ipynb and voice.csv – should be downloaded).

The code was originally written in Google Colaboratory and therefore imports data from Google Drive – if the notebook will be run in Google Colaboratory, the path for the required data should be reviewed and changed, if necessary. If the notebook will be run in any other environment, the first two rows of code (after imports) should be commented out, and the data should be located in the same directory as the notebook.
